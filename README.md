Python App to Allow for Users to share and recommend media to eachother.

Current Version is 0.01, I have used this project until now to learn a bit of XML and using some APIs via goodreads api.
I have a simple python script to give info about an author, given name as input from user.
This is a simple passion project that I've started to learn about making basic scripts with APIs.

#How to try out current version:
1. You must have the requests package [link: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/] and xml elementtree package [link: https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html] installed.
2. Download the fr.py
3. You need to obtain a goodread api key, and place it in fr.py as key
4. Run it by using $ python fr.py

#Next Steps Currently:
1. Flesh out goodreads search, to integrate books, authors, etc
2. Use goodreads recommendation to provide preliminary functionality

#Future Plans:
1. Integrate tastekids api to get wider range of recommendations
2. Integrate facebook in some way to give the app a social element
